                    First things first. You at least arrived early. Woke up at 6 am. Guess God is the one that really heleped you there. You did a good amount of reading yesternight. No doubt. Did the graphs of sin and tan and the thier inverses as well as the thinking behind them. Turned out to be really intuitive. Then today you got to understand a bit of limits and how to work them out. Consider maybe getting the references mentioned in the lecture. That should help you really get the hang of the content. There is also the idea where you are thinking of creating an AR and SR timetable. That should come in handy over time. Oh, and on the HTML thing too. Consider getting websites online and trying to model them using your own skills. that should help you learn on the spot as well as get better at using what you have already learnt.

                <h3>Call with Kip in the Morning</h3>
                    <p>
                    You also had a call with Kip today morning. Had a little catch up on the Don Moen thing. Do you regret not going. No doubt. You do. But you at least learnt some Html and Css. And yeah. On yesterday, you also had some time with Kamau at his place. Had njahi and chapo. The chapo, which you bought at First Class, didn't have salt. His beans was sweet though. Guess that's it for now.
